The solution usually involves carefully examining the `android/app/build.gradle`, `android/app/gradle.properties`, and the `google-services.json` (if using Firebase) files.

**Possible Fixes:**

* **Check Gradle Plugin Version:** Ensure the Gradle plugin version is compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Consult Expo's documentation for the recommended version.
* **Verify google-services.json:** If using Firebase, ensure `google-services.json` is correctly placed in the `android/app` directory and its contents match your Firebase project setup.
* **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning the project and rebuilding it: `cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && expo build:android`
* **Update Dependencies:** Make sure all your packages (including `expo-updates`) are up to date.
* **Inspect Build Logs:** Carefully examine the full error output of the Expo build process. The error message might provide clues about specific dependency conflicts or misconfigurations.

This is a general approach; the precise steps required will depend on the details of the error message and your specific project setup. If using Firebase, carefully check their documentation and configuration guide.
