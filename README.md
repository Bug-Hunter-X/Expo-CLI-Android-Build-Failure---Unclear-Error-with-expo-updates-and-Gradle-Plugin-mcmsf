# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Unclear Error with expo-updates and Gradle Plugin

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when building an Android app using the Expo CLI. The build process fails with an unhelpful error message related to `expo-updates` and Android Gradle plugin version compatibility.  The issue often stems from problems integrating Firebase or other services.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Attempt to build the Android app using `expo build:android`. 
5. Observe the build failure and the often-unclear error message.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the Android project configurations, ensuring the correct Gradle plugin version is used, and verifying the integrity of the `google-services.json` file (if Firebase is used) and related configurations.  The provided `bugSolution.js` file illustrates one approach to resolving this.  Specific fixes will depend on the individual project's dependencies and configurations.
